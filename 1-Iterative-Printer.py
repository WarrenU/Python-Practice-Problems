# Question:
# We have a list of integers.
# Write a function that prints the contents of the array so that the first line shows the first element,
# the second line shows the next two elements,
# the third line shows the next three elements and so on.

# Example input:1) [2,1,3,0,4,7]
#               2) [2,1,3,0,4,7,5,8]
#
# Example output: 1) Output:2
#                           1 3
#                           0 4 7
#                 2) Output:2
#                           1 3
#                           0 4 7
#                           5 8

# Explanation to my answer:
# My approach is using a left bounded and right(upper) bounded number.
#  upon every iteration it will lastly set the left bound where the upper right
#  bound had left off.
#  And to calculate the right bound I added up the numbers it was on per iteartion.
#    For example: The first iteartion would need a rbound of 1
#                 The second iteration would need a rbound of 3 (1 + 2)
#                 The third iteration would need a rbound of 6 (1 + 2 + 3)
#                 The fourth iteration would need a rbound of 10 (1+ 2 + 3 + 4)
#                 ..etc
